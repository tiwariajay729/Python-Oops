        "Extensibility: With polymorphism, new classes can be added to a system without modifying existing code. As long as the new class adheres to the same interface or inheritance structure, the existing code that uses polymorphism will automatically work with the new class.\n",

        "Inheritance: OOP allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes, facilitating code reuse. This can minimize redundancy and make it easier to create and maintain relationships between different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: This allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance, making code more flexible and easier to extend. Methods in different classes can have the same name but behave differently depending on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: OOP enables abstraction, meaning that you can expose only essential details to the outside world while hiding implementation details. This reduces complexity by focusing on high-level concepts and interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Maintainability: Since OOP focuses on modular, reusable code, it makes maintaining and updating software easier. Changes made to one class generally don't affect others, reducing the chance of bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scalability: OOP systems are often easier to scale because new features or objects can be added without disrupting the existing system. Classes can be extended, and polymorphism can ensure new functionalities fit within the existing architecture.\n",

        "Easier Troubleshooting and Debugging: With clear boundaries between objects and their responsibilities, it’s easier to isolate and troubleshoot issues in your code. Errors are often localized to specific objects or methods.\n",

        "Real-world Modeling: OOP makes it easier to model real-world systems because objects in code often represent real-world entities. This natural mapping can make the development process more intuitive.\n",
